# An Analysis of Book Publishers and Bestseller Lists, by GAIs-and-Dolls

### Summary

This is a data analysis of book publishers using the New York Times (NYT) Books API. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of book publishers in terms of their representation on NYT bestseller lists, in order to identify trends in the industry as a whole. The following conclusions were drawn from the analysis:

1. There is a high variability in book publisher performance across different genres.  
2. The book publishing industry exhibits a high degree of corporate consolidation.
3. There has been minimal change in market share distribution among the top 5 publishing companies, as per their time spent on the NYT Bestseller Lists.

### Book Publisher Performance on the Current NYT Bestseller Lists

At the time this analysis was undertaken, the latest NYT Bestseller lists were published on 9 April 2023. There are 56 publishers represented on the lists. The average number of weeks on the lists for these publishers' books is approximately 148. The median number of weeks on the lists is 46.5. The range of weeks on the lists is 1351, with the top performer's books spending 1352 weeks on the lists and the bottom performer's books spending 1 week on the lists. The standard deviation of weeks on the lists is approximately 241. Therefore, there is significant variability in book publisher performance, as measured by weeks spent on the NYT bestseller lists. The high variability in performance holds across different book genres. We note, however, that no one publisher holds a dominant position in multiple genres.   

### Consolidation in the Book Publishing Industry

    The preliminary analysis showcased a seemingly diverse industry, however, upon further exploration it was found that the list of publishers included in the raw dataset chiefly consisted of imprints and subsidiaries of larger publishing houses. Once that was determined, patterns and trends regarding presence on th Bestseller list were promptly recognized. In short, signifiant presence on the Bestseller list is not necessarily indicative of publishing quality, but could reflect strategic business growth, primarily through acquisition. 
    
### Time-Series Analysis 
    The analysis comprised of three two-year periods with 5 year intervals to analyze book publisher performance as well as usage share among all publishers. In the three time periods analyzed, the same 5 publishing companies (Penguin Random House, Simon & Schuster, Harper Collins, Macmillan, and Hachette Book) were most dominant, and on average accounted for 81% of total appearance. All other independent publishers, including self-published authors made-up the remaining 19%
    
    Penguin Random House retained the top spot in all three intervals with an average share of 39% of the total. This is especially significant because all other publishers account for a 19% combined average. There is a slight decrease in market dominance of Penguin in the 2019-2020 analysis, however, upon a brief exploratory look at the most recent years, they gain back the lost traction. The other four leading publishing corporations have also showcased minimal growth or decline indicating a level of stability in the industry.
