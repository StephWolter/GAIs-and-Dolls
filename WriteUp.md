### Book Publisher Performance on the Current NYT Bestseller Lists

At the time this analysis was undertaken, the latest NYT Bestseller lists were published on 9 April 2023. There are 56 publishers represented on the lists. The average number of weeks on the lists for these publishers' books is approximately 148. The median number of weeks on the lists is 46.5. The range of weeks on the lists is 1351, with the top performer's books spending 1352 weeks on the lists and the bottom performer's books spending 1 week on the lists. The standard deviation of weeks on the lists is approximately 241. Therefore, there is significant variability in book publisher performance, as measured by weeks spent on the NYT bestseller lists. The high variability in performance holds across different book genres. We note, however, that no one publisher holds a dominant position in multiple genres.
